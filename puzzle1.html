          <h2>Instructions:</h2>
          <p>The player must use the three clues to find the location of the treasure. However, there are also two dead-ends, which are meant to mislead the player. The dead-ends are statements that are true but do not lead the player to the location of the treasure. The player must use logic and deduction to determine which statements are relevant to the puzzle and which are dead-ends.</p>
